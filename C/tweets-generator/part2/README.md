# Tweets Generator – Part 2 (C)

This project is implemented in C and extends the Markov Chain infrastructure
developed in Part 1 with practical applications.

---

## Project Description

Part 2 applies the Markov Chain implementation to real use cases, demonstrating
how the same probabilistic model and data structures can be reused across
different applications.

In this part, the Markov Chain is used for:
- Random tweet generation
- Snakes and Ladders game simulation
