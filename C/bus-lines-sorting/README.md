# Bus Lines Sorting Project (C)

This project is implemented in C and focuses on sorting and testing bus line data using different criteria.

## Project Description
The program handles bus line information and allows sorting the data based on various attributes such as line number or distance.
It also includes a testing module to verify the correctness of the sorting logic.

## Files
- `main.c` – Program entry point.
- `sort_bus_lines.c / .h` – Sorting logic and related functions.
- `test_bus_lines.c / .h` – Unit tests for validating functionality.

## Technologies
- C
- Modular programming
- Header files
- Testing and validation

## What I Learned
- Writing modular C code using `.c` and `.h` files
- Implementing sorting algorithms
- Working with structured data
- Testing C programs
- Debugging and validation

## How to Compile
```bash
gcc main.c sort_bus_lines.c test_bus_lines.c -o bus_lines
